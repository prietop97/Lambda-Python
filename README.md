# Python-Training

Contains some of Lambda School daily projects, tutorials I have watched and code challenges.

## Lambda School Daily Projects

These are daily projects that I completed throughout my Lambda School journey, most assigments should be completed and fully functional.

#### What I learned

- Python
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Computer Architecture

## Coding Challenges

These are coding challenges that I have solved using Python, there won't be a lot since I usually use [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
